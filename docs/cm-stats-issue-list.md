# Issue List page

This page is a placeholder for a previously planned feature showing details about a certain task or an issue.  
It show the number of an issue (with a link to github) and its title, when it was last updated and if/when it was closed along side the number of comments made - a metric to possibly determine the relevancy of the issue.
